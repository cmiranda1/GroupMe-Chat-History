Originally I made this little app with the intention of analyzing a GroupMe chat my roommates and I have used since Freshman year of college, but figured that it would be a useful tool for anyone hoping to do something similar with their own group chat.
The program itself is a bit rough but it's easy to use and isn't too computationally expensive. You'll need your GroupMe Dev API Key that you can get from the following url:https://dev.groupme.com/
After that, run the program (Chat_History.py) and paste your key into the top left dialog box, and hit enter. The table widget should automatically fill with your most recently activated group chat, but you can change it to any group in your inventory with the drop down menu below the 'Enter' button. Once you've selected a chat, hit enter again and give the program a minute to process, the table should then change to reflect the information in the chat of your choice.
To download the entire chat history as an excel file, simply type in the full file name (including the .xlsx) into the top right dialog box and hit 'Save to Excel'. The file will then be saved to whatever directory the program was opened in. I've included a few simple charts I made with my own chat data. Hopefully the information is enough for whatever kind of analysis you were hoping to achieve, and thanks for checking it out!
